# P1-Image-Classification-AICTE-Internship

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Machine Learning model for image classification. The aim is to classify images into predefined categories using state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning. The project is modular, extensible, and designed to help researchers and developers understand and apply ML models to real-world datasets.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify images into predefined categories using a deep learning model.
- **State-of-the-Art Techniques**: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and modern architectures.
- **Performance Visualization**: Real-time accuracy and loss plots during training.
- **Dataset Flexibility**: Easily switch between standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) or custom datasets.
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular code design for easy experimentation and scaling.
